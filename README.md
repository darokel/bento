## What is Bento?

Bento is a modern and vanilla Rails 6 stack which adheres to the [Rails doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/) as much as possible. It's a starter template for building wonderful software products with Rails.

I created this template so you can hit the ground running and focus on your project without wasting time on boilerplate code.

### What's in the box?

Bento is designed to be lean and healthy with all the essentials for a productive and enjoyable development/testing workflow.

It provides a few staples:

- All the major [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 6 defaults (except for Test Unit in favour of Rspec)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) & [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) 5 for modern JavaScript with proper split css bundles. See `app/javascript/packs` for an example
- [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) and [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/) for SPA-like JavaScript sprinkles without the SPA complexity.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for easy JavaScript testing. See `app/javascript/controllers` for an example
- [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) for background jobs
- [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) for unit and system tests with 
- [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) with headless [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) integration tests and a pre-configured [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) config ready to go. See `spec/system` for an example. 

See [GOALS.md](GOALS.md) for more information on what's inside Bento and what isn't.
