# Contributing

I'm all up for pull requests if you see something which could be improved in the template and aligns with the template's [GOALS](https://github.com/darokel/bento/blob/master/GOALS.md). Alternatively, you can always fork the project and customise it to your own needs.

If you'd like to contribute then:

Fork the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:darokel/bento.git

Set up your machine:

    ./bin/setup

Make sure the tests pass:

    ./bin/rake

Write your changes and make sure tests pass with no style violations. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. 

I will do my best to review all PRs within a reasonable time.
